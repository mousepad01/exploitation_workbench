# exploitation workbench
This is where I put (most of) my exploitation practicing scripts, write-ups, and other related files. </br></br>
DISCLAIMER: </br>
This repo contains anything from my own scripts to binaries officialy used in some of the CTFs solved, and possibly other content that is NOT my own: this is a learning repository that helps me keep things organised, and might hopefully help someone else learning the same things. If you are the author of something that is posted here and you wish for a more explicit citation / removal, please contact me.

## Web exploits
The challenges are mainly taken from ringzer0ctf (and one from hackthebox academy), the script that executes the attack / text file writeup takes the name of the challenge

## Binary exploits
Each challenge is in its own directory, with its source described in info_BIBLIOGRAPHY file; some of the files were removed (mainly .so files),
but the original CTF binary was kept for convenience. The script that executes the attack is in scr.py or sploit.py, although some other py files
are used (copied from my other repo python_binary_exploit_utilites). There are also some other test binaries/C files/text files that might store
helpful information, but otherwise unnecessary for the challenge itself.

## Solidity exploits
There is no actual CTF, but a simple presentation that touches on some of the vulnerabilities in Ethereum Smart Contracts written in Solidity, 
along with the code of the attack/malicious contracts.
