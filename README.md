# exploitation workbench
This is where I put (most of) my exploitation practicing scripts, write-ups, and other related files. </br>
DISCLAIMER: <\br>
This repo contains anything from my own scripts to binaries officialy used in some of the CTFs solved, to chunks of code / write-up pieces publicly available on the internet, and possibly other content that is NOT my own: this is a learning repository that helps me keep things organised, and might hopefully help someone else learning the same things.
